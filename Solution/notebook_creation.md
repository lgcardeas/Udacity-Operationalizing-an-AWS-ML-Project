## SageMaker Instance creation
- I decided to create a CodeEditor Space since the begining of the course so I can keep track of everything I create in one place.
- I started with a small instance type, however I had to increse it over time to `ml.m5.2xlarge` as it was lagging and timming out a lot, so far, that instance is being able to process everything I have being doing.
