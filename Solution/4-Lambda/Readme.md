## summary
This Lambda function serves as a bridge between a client request and the SageMaker endpoint pytorch-inference-2024-11-21-00-25-38-124. It expects a JSON payload from the client containing the key url, which specifies the image URL to be sent for prediction. The function uses the boto3 library to invoke the SageMaker endpoint with the provided input, sending the data in JSON format. The prediction results are read from the endpointâ€™s response, parsed from JSON, and returned to the client along with appropriate HTTP headers. This design enables seamless integration with SageMaker for real-time inference on image data.
